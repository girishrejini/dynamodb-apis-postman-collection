# Explore Amazon DynamoDB APIs with Postman

[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is a fast and flexible NoSQL database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. 

It is,
* fully managed
* massively scalable
* highly available (99.999% Availability SLA with Global Tables)
* fully encrypted

DynamoDB has built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching. It can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and can support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.

This repo has a Postman collection (JSON file) of some of the commonly used DynamoDB APIs.
